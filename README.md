# These loosey scripts can be used to translate the script files of ADVSYS3 ENGINE.

## just unpack with ExAdvsys3.py or use GarBro then use [SExtrator](https://github.com/satan53x/SExtractor) with BIN and BIN VIOLENT to extract the files.
## Translate the file and pack the new file with PkAvdsys3.py and you're good to go, just make sure to delete the head.dat file from the game directory as the game will generate a new one.
